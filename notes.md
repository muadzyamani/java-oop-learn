# Introduction
## Why learn about object-oriented programming in Java

*   **Goal:** To learn how to use the object-oriented programming (OOP) model to write code that is reusable, maintainable, secure, scalable, and easier to troubleshoot.
*   The course will explore what object orientation means and how it is fundamentally embedded into the Java language.
*   **Key Concepts to be Covered:**
    *   Classes, instances, and constructors as methods for representing objects in code.
    *   How built-in Java libraries use object orientation.
*   **Approach:** The course will focus on concrete, practical examples to make abstract OOP concepts real.
*   **Core Principle:** It is essential to recognize that Java is an object-oriented language.

## What is object orientation?

*   **Definition:** A programming model based on modeling code around objects and data, which helps make code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.
*   **Example (A Tree Object):**
    *   **Attributes (Data):** Properties like `height` and `trunk diameter`.
    *   **Behaviors (Methods):** Actions the object can perform, like `grow()`, which can change the values of its attributes.
    *   **Object-Oriented Nature:** The attributes and behaviors are contained within a single unit (the "tree object") rather than being organized around a specific action.
*   **The Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Design:**
    1.  Abstraction
    2.  Inheritance
    3.  Encapsulation
    4.  Polymorphism
*   These principles are used in both custom programs and the Java source code itself to reduce complexity and encourage code reuse.
